\title{Conduct estimation and RMS test for paired repeated measures (PRM) designs of study}
\usage{
PRMtest(X, rho = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n by m matrix of paired measures}

\item{rho}{null threshold of acceptable RMS value}
}
\value{
\describe{
  \item{p.value}{ test p-values for: RMS test, score Z-test, Wald Z-test }
}
}
\description{
The problem can be reduced to a mixed effects model estimation under the RMS constraint. Due to the special structure of the
mixed effects model for the PRM designs, we can compute the likelihood analytically and hence efficiently calculate
MLE. See the reference of Bai et. al (2018). The score and Wald Z-tests are also implemented.

n=20; m=20; s2w=4.44; s2b=1.2; mu0=0.94; rho=3
e = matrix(rnorm(n*m), n,m)*sqrt(s2w)
u = rnorm(n)*sqrt(s2b)
X = mu0 + u + e
PRMtest(X,3)
PRMtest(X, sqrt(s2w+s2b+mu0^2))
