\title{Analytical power calculation for PRM design problem}
\usage{
PRMap(alpha = 0.05, n, m, s2w, s2b, mu, rho, REML = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{desired significance level. Default to 0.05}

\item{n}{number of subjects}

\item{m}{number of repeated measures for each subject}

\item{s2w}{within subject variation}

\item{s2b}{between subject variation}

\item{mu}{mean measure difference}

\item{rho}{null threshold of acceptable QMS value}

\item{REML}{using REML instead of MLE. Default to TRUE.}
}
\value{
\describe{
  \item{xq}{ computed quantile for the QMS test statistic }
  \item{size}{ computed actual type I error }
  \item{pwr}{ computed power }
  \item{par0}{ estimated null parameter values }
}
}
\description{
Due to its nature of composite null hypothesis, it is not trivial to derive the analytical power calculation. We develop an average log likelihood
based approach to quickly compute the power.
